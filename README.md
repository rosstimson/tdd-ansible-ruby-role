# TDD Ansible Ruby Role

This Ansible role installs Ruby by compiling it from source.  It is
used as an example in my blog post [Test-Driven Ansible with
Molecule](https://hashbangwallop.com/tdd-ansible.html).

**IMPORTANT** Clone this repo into a directory called `ruby` if
`molecule` is to run successfully without modifications:

    git clone https://github.com/rosstimson/tdd-ansible-ruby-role.git ruby
